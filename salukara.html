                <h2>About Salukara</h2>
                <h4>Salukara: The Ancient Filipino Pancake with Waray Roots</h4>
                <p>Move over, Western pancakes—the Philippines has its own ancestral version, and it's been around for centuries. Meet Salukara, a beloved breakfast rice cake from the Waray people of Eastern Visayas, particularly from Samar and Leyte.
                   Soft, tangy, slightly sweet, and gently crisp at the edges, Salukara is like the soulful cousin of a hotcake, made from fermented rice batter and traditionally cooked over banana leaves in a clay pot or iron pan. It's rustic, real, and ridiculously delicious.
                </p>

                    <span class="info-text"><b>Fun Fact:</b> Salukara is a traditional Waray pancake from Samar and Leyte, made with galapong (rice batter) and tuba (coconut wine) as a natural leavening agent—giving it a unique tangy flavor!</span>
                </div>
                <h4>A Taste of Waray Heritage</h4>
                <p>
                    Salukara is believed to have originated even before the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, when early Filipinos were already fermenting rice to make food that was nutritious, filling, and easy to cook. The fermentation method gave the dish a slightly sour flavor, much like Japanese sourdough pancakes or Ethiopian injera—proof that Filipino food has long embraced complexity.
                    The name “Salukara” comes from the Waray term for this rice pancake, which was often cooked in the morning for breakfast or served to guests during family gatherings and special occasions.
                    It was often made in households using traditional tools: burnay jars for fermenting, woodfire stoves, and banana leaves as both cooking liner and natural flavor enhancer.

                <div class="info-highlight">
                    <span class="info-icon">🔥</span>
                    <span class="info-text"><b>Tip:</b> If tuba (coconut wine) isn’t available, you can use yeast or a bit of vinegar to help ferment the rice batter and achieve that classic Salukara tang.</span>
                </div>
                <h4>What Makes Salukara Special?</h4>
                <p>
                    Unlike your typical pancake, Salukara is made with galapong—a batter made from soaked, ground rice. Its slightly fermented flavor, coupled with coconut milk and sugar, creates a warm, subtly tangy richness that pairs beautifully with coffee or native chocolate drink (tsokolate).
                    It’s light yet filling, rustic yet elegant in its simplicity. Salukara isn't just food—it’s a bite of ancestral wisdom passed down through generations.
                </p>
                <h4>Pancake from the Past, Still Loved Today</h4>
                <p>
                    In every bite of Salukara, you’ll find the essence of Waray tradition, the humble strength of Filipino ingredients, and the timeless beauty of cooking from scratch. It reminds us that sometimes, the best meals are the ones our ancestors knew by heart—no fuss, just flavor and memory.
                    So if you're ever in Samar or Leyte, ask for Salukara. And if you're far away from home, try making it yourself—and bring a taste of heritage to your table.

                            <li>2 cups glutinous rice (soaked overnight)</li>
                            <li>1 cup coconut milk</li>
                            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
                            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon instant yeast (optional, for quicker fermentation)</li>
                            <li>Banana leaves or oil (for lining the pan)</li>

                        <h4>Instructions</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Soak glutinous rice in water overnight.</li>
                            <li>Drain and grind (in a blender or food processor) with coconut mlk until smooth and pancake-batter consistency.</li>
                            <li>Add sugar and salt. Stir well.</li>
                            <li>Leave the batter in a warm place for 4–6 hours, or until it becomes bubbly and slightly sour. You may add yeast to speed up the process (ferments in 1–2 hours with yeast).</li>
                            <li>Heat a non-stick pan or griddle (traditionally lined with banana leaves).</li>
                            <li>Pour about ¼ cup of the batter onto the hot surface and spread into a small circle.</li>
                            <li>Cook over low to medium heat until the bottom is golden and bubbles form on the surface. Flip or cover to cook the top (some versions are left unflipped).</li>
                            <li>Best enjoyed hot off the pan, paired with local coffee, tsokolate, or a slice of salted egg on the side.</li>
