                <h2>About Durian Candy</h2>
                <h4>Durian Candy: The Bold and Sweet King of Mindanao</h4>
                <p>Ah, durian—the fruit that divides people like no other. You either love its creamy richness or politely hold your nose and walk away. But if there's one form of durian that even skeptics can fall in love with, it's Durian Candy—a smooth, fragrant, chewy treat that transforms this notorious fruit into something truly magical.
                   Found abundantly in Davao City and surrounding areas in Mindanao, Durian Candy is a must-try pasalubong that captures the exotic essence of the region in a bite-sized treasure.

                    <span class="info-text"><b>Fun Fact:</b> Durian Candy is a popular pasalubong from Davao City, where the “King of Fruits” grows abundantly. Its creamy, sweet flavor makes it a favorite treat even for those who find fresh durian too strong!</span>
                </div>
                <h4>A Fruit with Royal Roots</h4>
                <p>
                    Durian has long been cultivated in Southeast Asia, but in the Philippines, it found its throne in Davao, where the fertile soil and tropical climate helped it thrive. The fruit is so celebrated here that Davao hosts an annual Kadayawan Festival, where durian is the star attraction.
                    Historically, the practice of making durian candy arose from a desire to preserve the fruit and make it more accessible to those who found the raw version overwhelming. Locals discovered that by simmering durian pulp with milk and sugar, they could tame its strong aroma while keeping its unique taste—and thus, the now-famous candy was born.

                    <span class="info-icon">🔥</span>
                    <span class="info-text"><b>Tip:</b> For the best durian candy, use ripe durian flesh and cook it slowly with sugar and milk until thick and smooth—this brings out its signature creamy texture and aroma.</span>
                </div>
                <h4>Why Filipinos Love Durian Candy?</h4>
                <p>
                    Durian Candy is a testament to Filipino creativity and love for local flavors. It combines the rich, custard-like texture of the fruit with sweet creaminess to make a candy that’s both bold and comforting. Whether you buy it in soft caramel-like form or as bite-sized chewy squares, it’s a treat packed with flavor, tradition, and local pride.
                    And if you’re nervous about trying durian? Candy is the perfect way to ease into it—it’s like an introductory course into the kingdom of durian.
                </p>
                <h4>A Sweet That Stands Out</h4>
                <p>
                    Durian Candy isn't just a snack—it’s an experience. From the moment you unwrap it, you're met with the rich scent of the tropics, followed by a bite that’s soft, sweet, and unforgettable. For Davaoeños, it’s more than candy—it’s a source of identity and pride, a reminder that sometimes the boldest flavors leave the sweetest impressions.
                    So next time you’re in Mindanao or browsing a pasalubong shelf, don’t pass up the Durian Candy. It might just turn you into a believer.
